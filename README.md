Macroquad tamogotchi little game
===

You will raise a birds in this game. Probably will add something like motivation tracking (like habitica) or similar kind of stuff.
I try to use lottie animations in there. I wanted to use lottie-rs but there are too much dependencies. I hope I can make my own renderer not complex and able to render stuff that I animate in Synfig/Glaxnimate

# TODO:
- fix metal rendering by providing index_buffer
